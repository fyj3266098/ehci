# EHCI potential applications #

  * Input for game engines such as Ogre3D, Panda3D, jMonkey,

  * Compiz integration

  * Blender plugin

  * Head position based stereo sound

> The idea here would be to create 3d sounds related to head position. Another idea would be to use something that would model the sound recorded using two microphones and an ear model like the Virtual Barber Shop. This technology is called Binaural audio technology. I still don't know if we are able to create those sounds.

  * Augmented reality

  * Creating 3d models from our heads (like a 3d face scanner)
